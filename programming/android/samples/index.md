# Demo and Samples

## Samples

| Sample Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [HelloWorld](helloworld.md) | The simplest video streaming document normalizer. |

Before you start viewing the samples, the following concepts may help you understand how to get started with Dynamsoft Document Normalizer.

### License

A network connection is required to verify the trial license in the samples. You can request a 30-day offline trial license via the [Request a Trial License](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=ddn&utm_source=docs&package=android){:target="_blank"} link. If you download the [Installation Package](https://www.dynamsoft.com/document-normalizer/downloads/?product=ddn&utm_source=docs&package=android), it comes with a 30-day offline trial license by default.

### Video Document Normalizing

Most of the Dynamsoft Document Normalizer mobile samples are designed for video document normalizing. Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE) is applied to the video document scanning samples. The following features in the samples are powered by DCE:

- Capture video frames for quadrilateral area detecting.
- Create a `Camera View` for displaying the video streaming and highlighting the real-time detected quadrilaterals.
- Create an `Image Editor View` for quadrilateral boundary editing.

View the [API reference]({{site.dce_android }}primary-api/camera-enhancer.html) for more details.
